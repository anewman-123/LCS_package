# LCS_package

R Package that contains 4 functions for finding the longest common substring and the longest common subsequence of two strings. findLCS_simple returns the longest common substring using brute force and findLCS_dp returns the longest common substring using dynamic programming implementation. find_lcseqDp returns the longest common subsequence using dynamic programming implementation while find_lcseqRec returns the longest common subsequence using recursion. The functions were implemented differently in order to compare running times of brute force to dynamic programming and dynamic programming to recursion. After testing the accuracy of all of the functions, the package was applied to compare the human citrate synthase gene nucleotide base sequences of humans, rhesus monkey, and zebrafish.
