# LCS_package

R Package that contains 4 functions. One function returns the longest common substring using brute force and one function returns the longest common substring using dynamic programming. The two other functions return the longest common subsequence, with one funcion using recursive implementation and the other function using dynamic programming implementation. The functions were implemented differently in order to compare running times.
